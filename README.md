# Spell-Evator
a typing-test wave survival game where you cast spells on enemies by literally spelling. You must also use your mouse to move your shield and protect yourself against fast moving enemies that cant be defeated by spells.
This creates a frantic game where you switch between the mouse and keyboard to defend yourself.

## Story
Its a cold day in you're mythical world. You've just hit the jackpot and found loads of ancient crystals to magic with but the elevator sucks and its gonna take a long time, (almost endlessly long) to get to the top so you gotta use your magic and crystal shield to type your way to the top by casting spells and blocking mystical ghosts and gouls that get in your way.

## Controls
Type to cast Spells, and use your Mouse to move your Shield.
